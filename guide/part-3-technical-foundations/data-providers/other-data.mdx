## Overview

Beyond company, signal, and people data, VC funds often need specialized data: market intelligence, academic research, patents, financial data, and sector-specific sources.

## Market and Financial Data

### S&P Capital IQ

[S&P Capital IQ](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/solutions/sp-capital-iq-platform) provides comprehensive financial data, especially for public companies and later-stage private companies. Useful for comparables analysis, market sizing, and due diligence.

## Research and Academic Data

For deep tech and science-based funds, academic research and patent data are critical.

### Lens

[Lens](https://www.lens.org/) provides free access to patents and scholarly works. Good for understanding technology landscapes and founder research backgrounds.

{/* TODO: Add takes on Lens */}

### arXiv

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is the preprint server for physics, mathematics, computer science, and related fields. Essential for tracking cutting-edge research in AI/ML, quantum computing, and other technical areas.

### Semantic Scholar

[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) provides AI-powered research discovery. Useful for understanding citation networks and research impact.

## Patent Data

Patents indicate technology development and potential IP moats.

{/* TODO: Add patent data providers */}

## Sector-Specific Data

Some sectors have specialized data needs:

**Healthcare/Bio:**

- Clinical trial data
- FDA approval tracking
- Drug pipeline information

**Fintech:**

- Regulatory filings
- Banking data

**Climate/Energy:**

- Emissions data
- Energy market data

{/* TODO: Add sector-specific providers */}

## Considerations

**Specialized data requires domain expertise:** Market data and research data are only valuable if you can interpret them. These sources work best when you have domain expertise on your team.

**Often free or academic:** Unlike company data providers, research data is often free (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Lens). Budget for integration effort rather than subscription costs.
