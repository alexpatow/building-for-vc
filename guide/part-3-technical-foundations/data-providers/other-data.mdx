## Overview

Beyond company, signal, and people data, VC funds often need specialized data: market intelligence, academic research, patents, financial data, and sector-specific sources.

<Tip>
  This page isn't comprehensive, it's a starting point for inspiration. The specialized data
  landscape is vast and constantly evolving. If you've found a great resource that should be here,

## Market and Financial Data

| Provider                                                                                          | What It's For                                                             | Price |

## Research and Academic Data

For deep tech and science-based funds, academic research is critical for evaluating technical founders and understanding technology landscapes.

| Provider                                             | What It's For                                                                                      | Price |

## LLM-Powered Research Tools

LLMs with search capabilities are increasingly useful for market research, competitive analysis, and due diligence. Unlike traditional databases, these tools synthesize information from multiple sources and return cited answers.

| Provider                                     | What It's For                                                                             | Price |

| [Exa](https://exa.ai/)                       | AI-powered semantic search. Find similar companies, research markets, discover content.   | $     |

These tools are useful for:

- Quick market sizing and landscape overviews
- Finding competitors and similar companies
- Background research on founders or technologies
- Synthesizing public information during due diligence

The key advantage is that they return sources with their answers, so you can verify the underlying data. Integrate them into your research workflows via API.

## Considerations

**Specialized data requires domain expertise:** Market data and research data are only valuable if you can interpret them. These sources work best when you have domain expertise on your team.

See [Considerations](/guide/part-3-technical-foundations/data-providers/considerations) for cost and vendor relationship guidance.
