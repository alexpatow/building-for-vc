## Overview

You need external data about companies, funding, people, and markets. Data providers feed your CRM, power sourcing tools, and enrich your warehouse. But they're expensive, have different strengths, and deliver data differently.

This section covers what data you need, which vendors provide it, how to access it, and how to think about building your data stack.

## Types of Data You Need

VC funds need several categories of external data, each served by different providers.

**Company and funding data**: Basic information about companies (name, location, founding date, description, website) and their funding history (rounds, amounts, dates, investors, valuations). This is the foundation of your deal flow tracking, market analysis, and portfolio monitoring.

**People data**: Information about founders, executives, and employees. Who founded the company, who's on the leadership team, how many employees they have, where they're hiring. Essential for evaluating teams, tracking talent movement, and understanding company growth.

**Signal and sourcing data**: Early indicators that companies are growing, raising funding, or becoming interesting. Job postings, web traffic, social media activity, product launches, hiring velocity. Used by sourcing tools to identify companies before they're widely known.

**Market and competitive data**: Information about sectors, industries, technology trends, and competitive landscapes. What companies operate in a space, how markets are evolving, what technologies are emerging.

**Research data**: Academic papers, patents, and technical publications. Especially valuable for deep tech funds evaluating novel technology or scientific founding teams.
