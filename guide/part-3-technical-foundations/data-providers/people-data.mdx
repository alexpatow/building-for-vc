## Overview

People data is critical for evaluating teams. You need information about founders (background, previous experience, education), executives (who's leading the company), and employees (team size, hiring patterns, talent quality).

VCs invest in people as much as products. Understanding founder backgrounds, tracking talent movement, and evaluating team composition are core use cases.

## What You're Looking For

**Founder and executive profiles:**

- Work history and previous companies
- Education and credentials
- Previous exits and successes
- Board positions and advisors

**Team composition:**

- Employee count over time
- Department breakdown (engineering, sales, etc.)
- Leadership team changes
- Key hires and departures

**Talent signals:**

- Where people are moving from/to
- Hiring from strong companies
- Founder quality indicators

## Considerations

**Data privacy:** People data has privacy implications. Understand what data you're getting and how it was collected. Some regions (EU especially) have strict rules about processing personal data.

**Accuracy varies:** Professional profiles may be outdated. Current employer might be stale by months. Verify important information directly.

**Enrichment use cases:** People data is often used to enrich other data (add founder backgrounds to company records) rather than as a primary source.
