## Overview

Signal data helps you find companies before they're widely known. These are early indicators that a company is growing, raising funding, or becoming interesting: job postings, web traffic, social media activity, product launches, hiring velocity.

Signal providers are especially valuable for early-stage investors who need to source companies before they show up in traditional funding databases.

## What You're Looking For

**Hiring signals:**

- New job postings (especially leadership roles)
- Hiring velocity (how fast they're growing)
- Engineering team growth
- Location expansion

**Web and product signals:**

- Website traffic growth
- Product launches and updates
- App store rankings
- Social media activity

**Funding signals:**

- Indicators that a company is raising (even before announced)
- Investor interest signals
- Press and media coverage

**Founder signals:**

- New company formations
- Founder backgrounds and previous exits
- Team composition changes

## Considerations

**Speed vs accuracy:** Signal providers prioritize speed over perfection. The data might have gaps or errors, but you're seeing it before anyone else.

**Volume can be overwhelming:** These providers generate lots of signals. You need good filtering and scoring to avoid drowning in noise.

**Complement, don't replace:** Signal data works best alongside traditional company data, not instead of it.
