## Overview

What data you need depends on your fund: stage focus, sector specialization, team size, and budget. A pre-seed fund sourcing emerging founders needs different data than a growth fund doing due diligence on Series B companies.

This page outlines starter kits for different fund profiles. These are starting points, not prescriptions. Your specific needs will vary.

## Pre-Seed / Seed Focus

You're looking for companies before anyone else knows about them. Signal data matters more than comprehensive funding history.

**What you need:**

- Early-stage signal data (who's starting companies, what's trending)
- Founder and team data (background, previous experience)
- Basic company data (to track what you find)

**What you probably don't need yet:**

- Comprehensive funding databases (most of your targets won't be in them)
- Detailed financial data (too early for meaningful financials)

**Typical stack:**

{/* TODO: Add specific recommendations */}

## Series A / Series B Focus

You're evaluating companies with some traction. Need a balance of signal data and comprehensive coverage.

**What you need:**

- Funding history and investor data
- Growth signals (hiring, web traffic, product launches)
- Team composition and changes
- Competitive landscape data

**What you probably don't need:**

- Deep public market data
- Heavy patent/research databases (unless sector-specific)

**Typical stack:**

{/* TODO: Add specific recommendations */}

## Growth / Late Stage Focus

You're doing deeper due diligence on established companies. Comprehensive data and financial metrics matter most.

**What you need:**

- Comprehensive funding databases
- Financial and operational metrics
- Market and competitive analysis
- Public company comparables

**What you probably don't need:**

- Early-stage signal data (your targets are already known)

**Typical stack:**

{/* TODO: Add specific recommendations */}

## Deep Tech / Bio Focus

You're evaluating technical founders and novel technology. Research and patent data become critical.

**What you need:**

- Academic publication databases
- Patent and IP data
- Technical founder backgrounds
- Research institution connections

**Additional considerations:**

- Many deep tech companies won't appear in standard funding databases until later
- Founder evaluation requires different signals (publications, citations, lab affiliations)

**Typical stack:**

{/* TODO: Add specific recommendations */}

## Regional / Sector Specialist

You focus on a specific geography or vertical. Niche data providers often have better coverage than generalists.

**What you need:**

- Regional/sector-specific data providers
- Local market intelligence
- Sector-specific signals and metrics

**Key insight:**

Generalist data providers often have weak coverage outside US tech. If you invest in Europe, Asia, or specific verticals, look for specialized providers who focus on your market.

**Typical stack:**

{/* TODO: Add specific recommendations based on region/sector */}

## Budget Considerations

Your data budget should scale with fund size and strategy:

- **Small fund (<$50M):** Focus on 1-2 core providers. Start with what you absolutely need.
- **Mid-size fund ($50-250M):** Can afford broader coverage. 2-4 providers typical.
- **Large fund (>$250M):** Comprehensive coverage across categories. Multiple providers per category.
