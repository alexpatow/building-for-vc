## Overview

Company and investment data is the foundation of VC technology. You need information about companies (name, location, founding date, description, website) and their funding history (rounds, amounts, dates, investors, valuations).

This data powers your CRM, deal flow tracking, market analysis, and portfolio monitoring.

## What You're Looking For

**Company basics:**

- Name, description, website
- Location and founding date
- Industry/sector classification
- Employee count

**Funding history:**

- Investment rounds (dates, amounts, valuations)
- Investors in each round
- Lead investors and co-investors
- Total funding raised

**Investor data:**

- Which VCs invested in which companies
- Fund-level information
- Investment patterns and focus areas

## Considerations

**Coverage varies by geography and stage:** Some providers are stronger in US tech, others in European markets, others in specific stages. Test coverage against your target market.

**Data freshness matters:** How quickly does the provider capture new funding rounds? Some are faster than others.

**API vs dashboard:** Some providers focus on dashboard access, others have better APIs for programmatic access. Know what you need.
