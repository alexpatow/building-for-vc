## Considerations

**Coverage varies by geography and stage:** Some providers are stronger in US tech, others in European markets, others in specific stages. Test coverage against your target market.

**Data freshness matters:** How quickly does the provider capture new funding rounds? Some are faster than others.

**API vs dashboard:** Some providers focus on dashboard access, others have better APIs for programmatic access. Know what you need.
