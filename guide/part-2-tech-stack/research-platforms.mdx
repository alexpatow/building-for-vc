## Overview

The best advantage you have as an investor is clarity of thought. When everyone else is chasing the same hot deals, clarity lets you see opportunities others miss. When markets shift, clarity lets you adapt your thesis instead of following the herd.

Research platforms are the tool that helps you develop and maintain that clarity. Unlike CRM which tracks relationships, research platforms help you think clearly about where to invest in the first place.

This chapter covers how research platforms create competitive advantage and what you should build.

## Research as Competitive Advantage

Most funds operate reactively. Deals come in through the network. Partners evaluate them. Some get funded, most don't. The fund is a filter: deals flow in, a few flow out with investment. This is how venture capital has worked for decades.

The best funds operate proactively. They develop strong points of view about markets, technologies, and trends before seeing deals in those areas. They publish their thinking. They reach out to founders building in spaces they find interesting. When a company in their thesis area raises a round, they're already at the table because founders know their perspective.

This approach requires deep research about markets, technologies, business models, and secular trends. Not research about individual companies, that comes later, but macro research that identifies opportunities and develops into investment theses. The problem is that this kind of research is incredibly hard to do well without infrastructure. Where do you store evolving thinking? How do you connect research across different areas? How do you turn scattered insights into coherent theses? Research platforms solve this.

## What Research Platforms Do

Research platforms support the full cycle from macro research to investment conviction:

**Macro research and thesis development**: Start with broad questions. What's happening in infrastructure software? How is AI changing developer workflows? What new business models are emerging in healthcare? Research platforms give you space to explore these questions, capture insights, connect related ideas, and gradually develop coherent theses.

Unlike scattered documents, a research platform shows you connections. Your research about developer tools connects to your research about AI. Your analysis of a specific market connects to broader technology trends. Over time, patterns emerge. These patterns become theses.

**Publishing and demonstrating your thinking**: Once you've developed a thesis, you want to share it. Write it up. Publish it on your website or as a report. A research platform becomes the source material for published content. All your research about a topic is already organized and connected. You're not starting from scratch when you want to write something. You're synthesizing research you've already done.

Publishing serves multiple purposes. It demonstrates to founders that you understand their space. It attracts inbound from companies building in areas you find interesting. It forces you to clarify your own thinking. The act of writing for an audience sharpens fuzzy ideas into clear arguments.

**Building conviction before deals appear**: When you've spent months researching a market, you develop deep conviction. You understand the key players, the technology trends, the business model challenges, and the opportunities. When a company in that space raises a round, you don't need three months of diligence. You already have context. You can move quickly because you've already done the work. Everyone else is learning about the space from the company's pitch. You're evaluating whether this specific company is the right one to back in a space you already understand deeply.

**Institutional knowledge and collaboration**: Research compounds. When multiple people on your team research adjacent areas, their insights should connect. One partner researches infrastructure, another researches developer tools, a third researches AI. A good research platform surfaces the connections. The infrastructure research informs the developer tools research. The AI research connects to both.

This is how small teams can compete with large ones. Not by having more people, but by making each person's research more valuable through better connections and institutional memory.

## Key Features and Workflows

Research platforms that support thesis-driven investing need different features than simple note-taking tools:

**Networked research**: Ideas connect to other ideas. A research note about infrastructure connects to notes about developer tools, which connect to notes about specific technologies. The platform shows these connections explicitly. You're not just creating isolated documents. You're building a knowledge graph where insights emerge from the connections.

This is where tools like Notion fall short. They're great at hierarchical organization (folders and pages) but weak at networked thinking. You want bidirectional links, automatic backlinks, and the ability to see how different pieces of research relate.

**Market and technology research**: Research about markets, technologies, business models, and trends should be first-class entities, not just tags on companies. When you research infrastructure software, that's a substantial piece of work that should live independently. Companies building in that space link to it, but the market research stands on its own.

**Thesis development**: Convert research into theses. A thesis isn't just a collection of notes. It's a coherent argument about why a particular area is interesting. The platform should support drafting theses, getting feedback from the team, refining them, and eventually publishing them.

**Publishing workflow**: The path from research to published content should be smooth. Export research into article format. Share drafts with the team. Publish to your website. Track which articles get engagement. The platform bridges internal research and external communication.

**Company and founder tracking**: Yes, you still need this, but it's supporting infrastructure for the research, not the main event. When you're deep in infrastructure research and a relevant company appears, you want to quickly capture basic information and link it to your broader research. But the company profile is shallow compared to the market research.

**Search and connection surfacing**: When you're researching a new area, the platform should surface relevant existing research. You're looking into healthcare AI? Here's the healthcare research, here's the AI research, here's where those areas have intersected before. Let the platform help you avoid reinventing the wheel and find unexpected connections.

## The Build vs. Buy Decision

Research platforms are the strongest candidate for building internally because they're so specific to how your fund thinks. Generic tools work for storing notes, but they struggle to support the full workflow from macro research to published thesis. There's also a lack of VC-specific tools in the market in <CurrentYear />.

**When building makes sense**:

Your thesis development process is unique. How you explore markets, connect ideas, develop conviction, and publish thinking doesn't fit generic templates. A deep tech fund researching quantum computing needs to capture different connections than a consumer fund researching creator economy trends. The structure needs to match your intellectual process, not a standard note-taking pattern.

Publishing integration is critical to your strategy. If going from research to published articles is core to how you demonstrate expertise and attract founders, you need smooth workflows. Basic collaborative platforms can store drafts but struggle to help you synthesize months of networked research into coherent published content. Custom platforms can build this synthesis directly into the interface.

Networked thinking is central to your research approach. If your competitive advantage comes from connecting insights across different research areas, you need more than basic hyperlinks. When AI infrastructure research connects to developer tools research connects to specific technology bets, the relationships themselves become valuable. Custom platforms let you model these relationships explicitly.

The value compounds exponentially over time. Every piece of research makes future research more valuable. Every connection discovered feeds into better theses. Every published article attracts better inbound. This is infrastructure that creates lasting competitive advantage.

**When existing tools are sufficient**:

You're just starting thesis development and want to experiment with networked thinking approaches. Off-the-shelf tools built for this workflow let you explore what works before committing to custom development.

Your team is small and collaborative needs are basic. If two or three people are doing research, collaborative platforms with simple linking may be enough. The overhead of custom development outweighs the benefits.

Research and publishing aren't core to your competitive advantage. If you invest primarily through network deal flow and don't publish thinking externally, sophisticated research infrastructure may be overbuilding.

Building takes significant time. Three to six months for something genuinely useful. Longer to build something that supports your full research-to-publishing workflow. Make sure research and thesis development are actually core to your strategy before committing engineering resources.

## When to Prioritize This

Research platforms are most valuable at funds that compete on clarity of thought:

**Thesis-driven funds**: If your competitive advantage comes from deep conviction about where technology and markets are going (and making "moonshot bets"), research platforms are core infrastructure. You need to capture how you're thinking about a space, evolve that thinking over months, and eventually publish it to demonstrate your perspective. This is the foundation of your strategy.

**Funds that publish thinking**: If you write articles, publish reports, or create content demonstrating your expertise, a research platform becomes your content engine. All your research feeds into published pieces. You're not starting from scratch every time you write. You're synthesizing months of accumulated insights.

**Collaborative research teams**: If multiple people research adjacent areas and you want their insights to connect, you need infrastructure for networked thinking. One person researches AI, another researches developer tools, a third researches infrastructure. The connections between their work create unique insights.

Don't prioritize research platforms if you invest reactively based on network deal flow, don't develop public theses, are a solo GP with simple note-taking needs, or focus on late-stage deals where diligence is mostly quantitative analysis of business metrics.

## Common Tools and Approaches

Most funds should start with existing tools to understand their research workflow before building custom platforms.

**Networked thinking tools ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), [Anytype](https://anytype.io/))**: Built specifically for networked thinking with bidirectional links and graph views. Obsidian is especially popular with individual researchers doing deep thesis work. The markdown-based approach means your content isn't locked in. You can version control your research with Git, use it alongside Claude Code, and export to any format.

The main limitation is collaboration. These tools are built for individual use. Team collaboration requires sync solutions (Obsidian Sync, Git repositories, or shared folders) which work but feel less natural than true collaborative platforms. If you're a solo GP or small team comfortable with these workflows, they're excellent starting points.

When to use: Starting thesis development, experimenting with networked thinking, individual researchers who want powerful linking, teams comfortable with technical sync solutions.

**Collaborative platforms (Notion)**: Flexible and easy for teams to adopt. Many funds use Notion for research because everyone already knows how to use it. Real-time collaboration works well.

The weakness is that Notion is hierarchical by design, not network-first. You can link pages, but the mental model is folders and databases, not a knowledge graph. This matters less if your research is more structured and less if you're exploring complex connections between different research areas. Notion works well for collaborative drafts and can export to publishing platforms.

When to use: Teams that need easy collaboration, funds with more structured research processes, quick setup without technical complexity, good enough solution while you figure out what's missing.

**Custom-built platforms**: Funds serious about research as competitive advantage often build custom. Usually web-based (for Inflection: Next.js frontend, Postgres backend) with strong full-text search (pg_search or pg_vector extensions for semantic search).

The key technical challenges are more about product design than technology. How do you model relationships between research entities? What makes relevant connections surface naturally? How do you build publishing workflows that feel smooth? How do you ensure that the research experience is as good as your competition: Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity?

When to use: Research is core competitive advantage, you've outgrown existing tools and know exactly what you need, you have engineering resources, thesis development and publishing are central to your strategy.

**Recommended approach**: Start with Obsidian (if comfortable with markdown and sync solutions) or Notion (if team collaboration matters more). Use it for six months. Develop your research process. Figure out how your team actually explores markets, connects ideas, and develops theses.

Pay attention to what's frustrating. Can't find connections you know exist? Publishing workflow is too manual? Research isn't connecting to sourcing? These pain points tell you what to build. When you do build custom, you'll know exactly what features matter because you've felt their absence.

The key is making the path from internal research to published thinking as smooth as possible. If publishing demonstrates your thinking and attracts founders, the research-to-publishing workflow should be friction-free. This is often the feature that pushes funds toward custom platforms.

## Real Example: Kepler at Inflection

<Tip>
**Author Note: Building Kepler**

[Kepler](https://svrgn.substack.com/p/introducing-kepler-inflections-home), Inflection's research platform, came from watching how the GPs actually worked. Inflection is deeply thesis-driven. The partners spend significant time researching markets, technologies, and trends before deals show up. That research was scattered across Notion pages, Signal threads, and individual notes.

The problem wasn't organization. It was that insights weren't connecting. One partner's research about the changing European Defense Landscape couldn't easily inform another's work on counter UAV solutions. When it came time to write published content demonstrating our thinking, we'd start from scattered notes instead of synthesized research.

Kepler became the platform for thesis development. Market research, technology analysis, and meeting notes all lived together with explicit connections. When you researched AI Agents, you saw related infrastructure research and relevant developer tools work. The platform made it easier to see patterns across different areas of research.

The real value came when partners started using it as the source for published thinking. Instead of writing from scratch, they'd synthesize months of research captured in Kepler. The platform went from research storage to thinking tool to content engine.

## The Bottom Line

Research platforms are about developing clarity of thought and turning that clarity into competitive advantage. If your fund competes on deep conviction about markets and technologies, research is your foundation. Everything else builds on that.

The best investors don't just see more deals. They think more clearly about where to invest. Research platforms help you develop that clarity, maintain it over time, collaborate on it with your team, and demonstrate it publicly to attract the best founders.

Don't build a research platform to organize notes better. Build it to think more clearly, publish more coherently, and move faster when opportunities appear in spaces you already understand deeply.

In the next chapter, we'll look at sourcing tools, which help you find companies in the spaces your research has identified as interesting.
