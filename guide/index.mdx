title: "Building for Venture Capital"
description: "A technical guide to building technology for VC funds: from understanding the domain to shipping production systems."
---

## Welcome

Most people building technology for VC funds are outsiders. They're talented engineers who've never worked in venture capital, don't know how funds actually operate, and end up wasting time building the wrong things.

This guide is the insider knowledge I wish I had when I started: the stuff that saves you from painful mistakes and helps you ship what actually matters.

<Note>
  **A note on perspective**: This guide reflects my personal experience building VC infrastructure.
  Your mileage may vary. Every fund is different, and what worked for me might not be the right
  approach for yours. Use this as a starting point, not gospel. Dissenting opinions welcome!

</Note>
