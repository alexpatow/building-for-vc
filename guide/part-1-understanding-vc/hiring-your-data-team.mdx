## Overview

Most VC funds struggle with their first technical hire. They don't know what skills to prioritize, what level of experience to target, or how the role should evolve over time. Get this wrong and you'll either have someone who can't operate independently in an ambiguous environment, or someone who oversells capabilities and underdelivers.

This chapter covers when to hire, what to look for in your first data person, and how to grow the team as your needs evolve.

## When to Hire Your First Data Person

The best funds hire proactively, before they realize they need it. But the right timing depends heavily on fund size and strategy.

**Signals that you're ready:**

- Partners are spending significant time on manual data tasks that could be automated
- You have a specific technical initiative that needs leadership (not just a vague "we should be more data-driven")
- The fund has conviction that data and technology will be core to differentiation, not just operational efficiency
- You have budget for both the hire and the tools/infrastructure they'll need

**Signals that you're not ready:**

- "Data-driven" is a buzzword in your marketing, not a real strategy
- You expect one person to solve all technical problems while you figure out what you actually need
- There's no budget for data subscriptions, cloud infrastructure, or tooling beyond salary
- Partners aren't willing to invest time in defining problems and giving feedback

Many successful funds operate without dedicated technical staff. They use off-the-shelf tools like Affinity or Attio, outsource specific projects, and focus their energy on deal sourcing and portfolio support. The decision to hire should be driven by your fund's specific needs and strategy, not by what other funds are doing.

## What to Look for in Your First Hire

<Tip>
**Hiring advice from [Ties Boukema](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiesboukema/) at Dawn Capital**

The first data hire should be able to sell the vision of what's possible with data internally and generate excitement among partners.
They need to be self-motivated to identify opportunities where data can add value and pitch their own projects.

Investors typically lack technical intuition about data capabilities and timelines, so data hires need to be proactive problem-identifiers who can independently scope and drive their own work rather than wait for assignments. This is different from typical banking or consulting analysts who are accustomed to working on urgent, well-scoped deliverables.

</Tip>

How much you weight vision-selling versus hands-on execution depends on fund size and team structure. At larger funds where you're building a team, you can separate leadership (selling the vision, setting strategy) from execution (building the infrastructure). At smaller funds where one person does everything, vision-selling and technical depth have to coexist in the same hire.

**The ideal first hire is a generalist who can:**

- Context-switch across data infrastructure, internal tools, and integrations
- Work independently in an ambiguous environment without clear requirements
- Translate business problems into technical solutions (see [Mistake #7: Treating Investors Like Engineers](/guide/part-1-understanding-vc/common-mistakes#mistake-7-treating-investors-like-engineers))
- Set realistic expectations and deliver on them

**Domain experience matters more than specific technical skills.** Someone who understands venture capital and can build tools GPs actually use is more valuable than a specialist who doesn't understand your users. Technical skills are learnable. Product sense in a specialized domain like VC is harder to acquire.

**Hiring too junior is the biggest mistake funds make.** Someone early in their career, even if technically capable, often struggles without external structure. Look for someone who has shipped projects end-to-end with minimal supervision.

## How Hiring Evolves

Don't hire a second person until the first hire has identified clear workstreams to divide.

The first hire's job isn't just building tools. It's discovering what the fund actually needs: experimenting with different projects, identifying where sustained investment makes sense versus where quick wins are sufficient.

**When to hire a second person:**

- You have clear, separable workstreams (e.g., data infrastructure vs. internal tools vs. ML/AI initiatives)
- The first hire is consistently underwater despite good prioritization
- You've identified a big swing that requires dedicated focus and the first hire can't abandon other responsibilities

**When hiring specialists (ML engineers, data engineers, etc.):**

- Only hire specialists when there's enough work to keep them occupied long-term
- A specialist with nothing to do will either leave or start building things you don't need
- If you want to take a big swing on AI/ML, use the first hire to scope it and build the data infrastructure to support it, then hire someone dedicated to that initiative
- For niche specialties with uncertain long-term demand, use consultants for the initial build. Larger funds often do this: bring in external help to ship something, then decide whether the workstream justifies a full-time hire

The pattern is: generalist first to figure out what matters, then specialists for sustained investment in specific areas.

## Compensation and Role Definition

VC fund technical roles sit awkwardly in the market. You're not a big tech company with standard levels and compensation bands. You're not a startup with equity upside. You're a small team at a financial firm, which means different expectations on both sides.

**On compensation:**

- Base salaries are typically in line with tech companies
- Carried interest (carry) is still rare for technical hires but becoming more common, especially at senior levels
- Equity is non-existent (VC funds don't have equity like startups do)
- The value proposition is: interesting problems, high autonomy, direct impact, exposure to the startup ecosystem

**On role definition:**

- Titles vary by firm. Some use "CTO," others prefer "Head of Data" or "Head of Engineering"
- Be clear about scope: are they building tools for deal flow, portfolio analytics, LP reporting, all of the above?
- Define the reporting structure: do they report to a partner? The COO? Operating independently?
- Beyond formal reporting, identify which stakeholders outside the investment team they'll work with – operations, finance, investor relations – and ensure those people are bought in on the hire

## Red Flags in Candidates

Watch out for these warning signs:

**No evidence of independent ownership.** Ask about projects they drove end-to-end. If every example involves working within a well-defined scope set by someone else, they'll struggle in a VC environment.

**Dismissive of "boring" work.** Data pipelines, integrations, and internal tools aren't glamorous. If a candidate only wants to work on interesting technical problems, they won't do the unglamorous work that actually matters.

**Can't explain technical concepts simply.** They'll be working with non-technical people every day. If they can't translate technical trade-offs into business terms, they'll struggle to get buy-in for projects. (See [Mistake #7](/guide/part-1-understanding-vc/common-mistakes#mistake-7-treating-investors-like-engineers)).

## The Bottom Line

Your first hire should be a generalist who can sell the vision and deliver on it. Prioritize domain experience over technical specialization. Avoid hiring too junior. Let your first hire identify what actually matters before expanding the team.

In Part 2, we'll shift from understanding VC to the practical work of building: what tools exist, when to buy versus build, and how to put together a tech stack that serves your fund's needs.
