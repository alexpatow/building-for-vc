## Overview

Your website and external presence are how founders and LPs discover you. Before a founder takes your call, they look at your website. Before an LP considers your fund, they research your online presence. These are first impressions that matter enormously.

This is less about technology and more about branding, design, and content. The technology should be simple and stay out of the way. What matters is that your website clearly communicates what your fund is about, looks professional, and makes it easy for people to understand if you're the right investor for them.

Your external presence extends beyond your website to published research, social media, and anywhere else people encounter your fund online. This ties directly back to research platforms (Chapter 5) - publishing your thinking is how you demonstrate expertise and attract the right founders.

This chapter covers how to approach your website, what technology choices make sense, and how to think about your broader external presence without overcomplicating it.

## Your Website

Your fund's website is often the first thing founders or potential LPs see. It's worth investing in getting it right.

**Hire design help**: Unless you have design expertise on your team, hire a brand agency to design your website. The difference between a professionally designed site and one you design yourself is immediately obvious. Founders and LPs are forming judgments based on these first impressions.

At Inflection, we worked with an external brand agency to design the website. They handled visual design, branding, and user experience. We implemented it ourselves using their designs. The results were much better than if we'd tried to design it internally. Good design communicates professionalism and attention to detail before anyone reads a word of your content.

**Use a modern CMS**: Choose a content management system that makes it easy to update your website without editing code. You'll get frequent requests to update content: adding new investments, updating team member bios, changing copy, publishing new content. If updating the website requires a developer every time, it becomes a bottleneck.

We use Sanity. It's a modern headless CMS that lets team members update content through a clean interface. When we make a new investment, anyone on the team can add it to the portfolio page. When we want to update copy, it's a quick edit in Sanity rather than a code change. This is the kind of practical convenience that matters day-to-day.

Other good options include Contentful (another headless CMS) or even WordPress if you want something established and familiar. The key is that non-technical team members should be able to update content themselves.

**What your website should communicate**:

Your fund's investment focus. What stages do you invest at? What sectors or technologies? What geography? Founders should know immediately if you're relevant to them.

Your portfolio. Show your investments prominently. This builds credibility and helps founders understand what types of companies you back.

Your team. Who makes investment decisions? What are their backgrounds? LPs and founders both care about this. Make it easy to understand who they'd be working with.

Your thinking. If you publish research or have strong points of view, feature this content. It demonstrates expertise and helps attract founders in spaces you understand deeply.

How to reach you. Make it easy for founders to get in touch. Clear contact information, ideally a simple way to submit a pitch or introduction request.

**Branding is essential**: Your website should reflect the type of fund you are. A deep tech fund focused on technical founders should feel different from a consumer fund focused on brand and community. Your visual identity, tone, and content choices all communicate who you are. This is why design help matters - good designers understand how to make these choices cohesively.

## Publishing Research and Thought Leadership

This ties directly to research platforms (Chapter 5). If you're doing deep research on markets and technologies, publishing that research builds your brand and attracts founders.

**Why publish**: Publishing demonstrates expertise in your focus areas. When a founder is building in infrastructure software and they read your detailed analysis of the infrastructure market, they're more likely to reach out to you. Publishing is how you show founders you understand their space before they ever talk to you.

Publishing also attracts inbound deal flow. Founders building in spaces you've researched see your content and realize you're a relevant investor. This is proactive deal generation through content rather than through systematic sourcing.

**Where to publish**: You have several options. Many funds use Substack for regular content (Inflection does). It's simple, familiar to readers, and lets you build an email list of subscribers. Others publish on Medium, which has built-in distribution through its platform. Some funds publish directly on their website using their CMS.

The platform matters less than the consistency and quality of the content. If you're publishing thoughtful research regularly, the specific platform doesn't make much difference.

**What to publish**: The research you're already doing (if you followed Chapter 5). Market analysis, technology trends, thesis pieces about where you're investing and why. Turn your internal research into external content. If you're researching AI infrastructure deeply, publish that research. It demonstrates your thinking and attracts companies in that space.

The key is that publishing should come from real research, not be forced marketing content. Founders can tell the difference. If your published content reflects genuine deep thinking about markets and technologies, it works. If it's shallow content created just to have something to publish, it doesn't help.

## Social Media and Other Channels

Beyond your website and published research, social media is where much of your external presence lives.

**LinkedIn and Twitter**: These are table stakes for any fund. Share portfolio news, team updates, published research, and relevant industry content. Like any company, you want to be active and engaged on these platforms.

Individual partners having their own presence on LinkedIn and Twitter often matters more than the fund's official accounts. When partners share their thinking, make introductions, and engage with their networks, it builds the fund's reputation through their personal brands.

**Other platforms**: Some funds use Instagram, TikTok, or other platforms. This usually makes sense only if you have dedicated marketing resources. Instagram works well if you're building a brand around community or visual content. But it requires consistent effort and content creation.

Unless you have a marketing person focused on this, don't feel pressured to be on every platform. Focus on LinkedIn and Twitter where your target audience (founders and LPs) already are. Do those well before expanding to other channels.

**The technology perspective**: There's not much technology infrastructure needed for social media presence. You're using the platforms themselves. The work is creating good content and engaging consistently. Scheduling tools (Buffer, Hootsuite) can help if you're managing multiple accounts, but the core work is content and community, not technology.
