This book is for technical people building software for venture capital funds: data engineers, software engineers, CTOs, and technical founders creating tools for the VC ecosystem.

It's about understanding how VC works, analyzing your specific fund's needs, and building the right technology without common mistakes. It combines domain knowledge with practical technical guidance from real experience at funds like Inflection and EQT.

## How to Read This Book

If you're new to VC, read Part 1 sequentially to build foundational understanding. If you're building specific features, jump to relevant chapters in Parts 2 and 3.

Each chapter is self-contained but builds on concepts from earlier chapters. Code examples, real-world cases, and architectural decisions are included throughout.

<Note>
  This book is continuously updated as the VC technology landscape evolves. The principles remain
  constant, but specific tools and recommendations reflect current best practices.
